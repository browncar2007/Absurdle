This program runs a variation of the Wordle game called absurdle.
The user tries to guess a hidden word of a chosen length and 
the program returns colored patterns showing how close the guess is. 
Unlike Wordle the absurdle manager avoids reveling the secret word for as long as possible by
adjusting the target word and pruning the dictionary as little as possible.
